# Horiseon Refactor

# Description
* This project is a code refactor for Horiseon's homepage. Without changing the design of the homepage, refactoring was needed to meet accessibility standards and to make the code more efficient. This should result in improved SEO. 

# Tasks Completed
* Original HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
* Alt attributes added to images for accessibility standards
* Consolidated repeating classes
* Explanatory comments were added in both HTML and CSS files
* CSS reorganized to meet sequential order
* A descriptive title was added
* Links were fixed
